# üíª Promptopia - Prompt Sharing Application

This project is a full-stack web application built with **Next.js**, featuring complete **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionality integrated with a **MongoDB** database. It uses **NextAuth.js** to implement secure user authentication and session management, allowing protected access to specific routes and operations. The application showcases how to build a scalable and modern web app using **Next.js API routes** for server-side logic, **Mongoose** for database interactions, and modular architecture to keep the codebase clean and maintainable. I created this project as a way to deepen my understanding of full-stack development, particularly how to combine authentication, database operations, and the power of the Next.js framework. It served as a hands-on learning experience to improve my skills in building scalable, secure, and modern web applications.
